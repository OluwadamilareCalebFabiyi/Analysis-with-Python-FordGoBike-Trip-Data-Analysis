## SUMMARY

### 1) The Company has experienced Growth overtime
The growth of the company is evident in the fact that there has been a systematic increase in the number of trips per month except for an observed reduction in Novembers and Decembers.

### 2) There is an observed decrease in patronage repeatedly in Novembers and Decembers.
There is noticed repeated sudden drop that deviates from the normal trend of trips increase in number of trips in November and December which surges again in January.

This phenomenon should be further investigated as there are no informations to establish a reason for this sudden decrease.

### 3) Customers( Non Subscribers ) ride more on weekends than weekdays while Subscribers ride more during workdays than weekends.

Riders who are just casual customers and not subscribers ride more during weekend than weekdays.

Riders who are subscribers ride more doing workdays and ride less in weekends.

### 4) Customers( Non Subscribers ) ride for a longer duration than subscribers and there is an observed relatively more trip durations during weekends than workdays.

Riders who are casual customers ride for longer trip duration than subscribers.

Riders who are casual customers ride more during weekends than workdays therefore the observed relatively more trips duration during weekends can be attributed to it.

### 5)  Trips peak everyday around 8a.m-9a.m and 5p.m-6p.m for both subscribers and custiomers though customers have relatively more trips than subscribers between 9a.m to 5p.m.

It is suspected that people take bikes when going to work in the morning and when returning in the evening.

Customers take trips more than subscribers between 9a.m to 5p.m and considering the fact that there are aso more customers on weekend, we can suspect that most customers don't use the bikes to navigte to and from work, mostly subscribers do.
